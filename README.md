# PLP-PYTHON-FINAL-PROJECT
# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries over time. Using Python data analysis tools, the project cleans real-world data, performs exploratory data analysis, generates insights, and visualizes trends.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries and regions
- Visualize trends with various charts
- Communicate findings through a Jupyter Notebook report

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: For numerical operations
- matplotlib: For creating visualizations
- seaborn: For enhanced visualizations

## Dataset
The project uses the "Our World in Data" COVID-19 dataset which includes daily updates on:
- Confirmed cases
- Deaths
- Testing
- Vaccinations
- Hospital & ICU
- Reproduction rates
- Policy responses

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed
3. Open the `COVID-19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run all cells in sequence

## Key Insights
1. **Case Growth Patterns**: The United States showed the steepest growth in total cases among analyzed countries, followed by India, while Kenya had a more moderate growth trajectory.
2. **Death Rates**: Death rates varied significantly between countries and over time, with higher rates early in the pandemic due to limited testing and healthcare knowledge.
3. **Vaccination Progress**: Vaccination rollout showed different patterns across countries, with developed nations generally achieving higher vaccination rates faster.
4. **Regional Differences**: Significant variations in how COVID-19 impacted different regions appeared to be influenced by factors such as population density, healthcare infrastructure, and policy responses.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: For Kenya specifically, strong correlations between total cases and deaths indicated consistent case fatality rates over time.

## Project Reflections
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in understanding global health crises. The analysis highlights disparities between countries in healthcare resources and pandemic responses. Further analysis could incorporate additional factors such as testing rates, healthcare capacity, and specific policy interventions to gain deeper insights.
